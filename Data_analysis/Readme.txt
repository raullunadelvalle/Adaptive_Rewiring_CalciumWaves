
1- Once the Adaptive rewiring algorithm has been run and evolved networks have 
been outputed, it is time to analyse their topologies.

Run the script "Network_Metrics.py". The outputs will be stored in the folder
named "Metrics". If this folder does not exist, plese, create it in this same 
directory where this readme is located.

2- Then, you may run in no particular order the Matlab scripts 
(i.e. ended in ".m") to create figures like those in:

Luna, R., Li, J., Bauer, R., & van Leeuwen, C. (2023). Retinal waves in adaptive 
rewiring networks orchestrate convergence and divergence in the visual system.

Please, be aware that the Matlab scripts integrate Python functionalities. 
Therefore, you may need to launch Matlab from, for instance, the Anaconda prompt.

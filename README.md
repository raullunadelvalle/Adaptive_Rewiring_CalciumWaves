# Adaptive_Rewiring_CalciumWaves

Scripts needed to perform the adaptive rewiring simulations and data analysis in 
the article: 

Luna, R., Li, J., Bauer, R., & van Leeuwen, C. (2023). Retinal waves in adaptive 
rewiring networks orchestrate convergence and divergence in the visual system.

1- You will first need to enter the "scripts" folder (plese, see Readme inside).

Once in this folder:
- First run “HPC_Initial_networks.py”
- Then run “HPC_Adaptive_rewiring.py”

This will generate initial random networks that will evolve through the Adaptive
Rewiring algorithm

2- To analyse the topologies of the resulting networks, enter the "Data_analysis"
folder (plese, see Readme inside).

Once in this folder:
- First run the script "Network_Metrics.py".
- Then run in no particular order the Matlab scripts (i.e. ended in ".m").
